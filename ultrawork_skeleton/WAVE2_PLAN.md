# Wave 2 Plan: Ultrawork Orchestration Prototyping

- Objective: Finalize an explicit Ultrawork orchestration design and a concrete Wave graph to enable rapid prototyping in Wave 3. Include dependencies, a rollback plan, and clear wave sequencing.
- Orchestration design (core components)
  - PlanManager: central API to register, retrieve, and list waves/plans
  - ParallelRunner: lightweight parallel executor to run independent tasks concurrently
  - EnvLoader: simple environment configuration loader with optional .env support; basic validation
- Waves and sequencing
  - Wave 1: Discovery and environment assessment (completed)
  - Wave 2: Planning and scaffolding design (finalize interfaces, dependencies, rollback)
  - Wave 3: Prototype scaffolding (code skeleton + minimal parallel demo)
- Dependencies
  - Language: Python 3.8+
  - Testing: pytest
- Rollback plan
  - If Wave 2 changes fail to integrate, revert to the last stable skeleton and sustain a minimal plan doc to guide the next sprint
- Blockers / Input
  - Language choice confirmation (Python confirmed; Node.js optional later)
- Acceptance criteria
  - Plan document is unambiguous and actionable
  - Wave 3 skeleton compiles and runs a 3-task parallel demo
- Deliverables
  - Wave 2 plan document
  - Skeleton and tests
